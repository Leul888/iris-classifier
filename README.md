A full-stack machine learning app that classifies Iris flowers using a trained model, served through a FastAPI backend and a Streamlit frontend.

✅ Features
🔍 ML Model: Trained and saved with scikit-learn

🚀 FastAPI: Serves predictions via HTTP POST

🖼️ Streamlit UI: Clean interface for user input and viewing predictions

🔗 Integration: Frontend communicates with backend via JSON

🖥️ Local Deployment: Fully runnable on your machine like a deployed service

🧠 How It Works
Streamlit collects user input

Sends a POST request to the FastAPI server

FastAPI loads model.pkl and returns the predicted Iris species

Streamlit displays the prediction
